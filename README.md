# DS-Portfolio

Hi there! Welcome to my DataScience-Portfolio repository containing various exercises and projects completed in Python Jupyter notebooks contributed towards my learning of Data Science concepts. 

Having slightly touched on Big Data Analytics at university, I have been quite interested in Data Science as a whole ever since my graduation. Since graduating, I work full time as a Biomedical Engineer but to feed my inquisition I have completed a Data Science course at General Assembly and also spend time some time completing random micro porjects on Kaggle. As I go thorugh I will be uploading them here. If you're already seeing this and there isn't much on here - it is still a work in progress :)
